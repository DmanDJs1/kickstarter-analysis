Our initial analysis was focused on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends. For starters in the United States, we found that there were 525 successful theater Kickstarters campaigns. We also have found that the "theater" in Great Britain. As far as which timeframe in terms of dates, the month that launched the most successful funding campaigns was the month of May. On the other hand, January, June, July and October all had failed campaigns. Note that we researched musicals in Great Britain to determine if a future project with an estimated budget of £4,000 can be successfully launched and given the data we would advise to attempt a production with less £4,000.
