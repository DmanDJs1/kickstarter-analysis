Our initial analysis was focused on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends. For starters in the United States, we found that there were 525 successful theater Kickstarters campaigns. We also have found that the "theater" in Great Britain. As far as which timeframe in terms of dates, the month that launched the most successful funding campaigns was the month of May. On the other hand, January, June, July and October all had failed campaigns. Note that we researched musicals in Great Britain to determine if a future project with an estimated budget of £4,000 can be successfully launched and given the data we would advise to attempt a production with less £4,000.  
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The over of the project was to show our client Louise how the time to kickstart certain campaigns and dollars effects outcomes.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to show Louise how different campaigns fare in relation to launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenges and limitations I encountered was my understanding and knowledge of EXCEL.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? See below

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? See below

- The way both analysis were conducted showed the following: 1) the correlation of dollar amounts in relation to successful, failed, and canceled campaigns concluded that they are both indirectly related and the dollar amount between $45,000 and $50,000 were the most successful. 2) We also saw that launching a theater campaign in the month of May was the most successful.
